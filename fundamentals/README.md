## Purpose
This folder contains minimal sanity checks and utilities used across later
sequence-modeling experiments. After doing the stuff on the register we can implement the corresponding codes here to make sure the understanding is complete. Graphs etc will  help complete and document the process.

## MUST include:
- Numerical gradient checking
- Loss surface visualization (simple 2D)
- Softmax stability check
- Optimizer behavior comparison

## MUST NOT include:
- Long derivations
- Fancy datasets
- Model zoo

## Covered topics
- Linear & logistic regression (loss + gradients)
- Backpropagation in simple neural networks
- Softmax & cross-entropy
- Optimization behavior (SGD, Adam, AdamW)

## Excluded topics
- ML heavy stuff that is not relevant 
- Tree-based models
- KNN
- Naive Bayes
- SVM (kept conceptual only)

## Philosophy
Derivations and deeper explanations are maintained in a separate
physical research notebook.
